### New Beginnings Orientation

### Accessing Sinai Central, Email, and Campus Wi-Fi via VPN

When your IT/Network access is established, you will be assigned an MSSM username, which can be used to access Sinai Central and your email.

First, you must set up two factor authentication [here](https://itsecurity.mssm.edu/vip-two-factor-setup/). If you are not on campus Wi-Fi, you must use the HPIMS Ticketing System to register your VIP token remotely. The Ticketing System can also be used to request access to data or VMs on Azure, or access to internal servers. Using VIP two factor authentication, you can use a VPN (such as BIG-IP Edge Client) to connect to campus Wifi and then access webmail.

The HPIMS Directory Form and MSCIC Onboarding Form should be submitted out before accessing data.

### Accessing Data

The HPIMS ticketing system can be used to request access to the HPIMS Azure and Minerva. The MSCIC Onboarding Form grants access to the MSCIC data.

Before being added to an HPIMS Project, submit CITI training certificates, CV and the HPIMS Data Use Agreement (DUA) via the Regulatory Submission Form as per the HPIMS Onboarding SOP. As of September 2020, this form requires Certificates of completion of following CITI trainings:
  - Investigator/Research Staff Basic Course
  - HIPAA for Research Update
  - Data Security and HIPAA training
  - Rigor, Reproducibility and Ethical Behavior in Biomedical Research
  - Good Clinical Practice (if applicable)
