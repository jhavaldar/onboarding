### New Beginnings Orientation

### Accessing Sinai Central, Email, and Campus Wi-Fi via VPN

When your IT/Network access is established, you will be assigned an MSSM username, which can be used to access [Sinai Central](https://sinaicentral.mssm.edu/) and [your email](http://mail.mssm.edu).

First, you must set up two factor authentication [here](https://itsecurity.mssm.edu/vip-two-factor-setup/). If you are not on campus Wi-Fi, you must use the [HPIMS ticketing system](https://app.smartsheet.com/b/form/ab5208921ad64f02b322047d788a4605) to register your VIP token remotely. The Ticketing System can also be used to request access to data or VMs on Azure, or access to internal servers. Using VIP two factor authentication, you can use a VPN ([such as BIG-IP Edge Client](https://itsecurity.mssm.edu/vpn-tunnel-with-f5bigclient/)) to connect to campus Wifi and then access webmail.

*Note:* Email can also be accessed without connecting to campus Wifi. First, if you have not already, [set up two factor authentication](https://itsecurity.mssm.edu/vip-two-factor-setup/). Then, follow the [instructions for external webmail access here](https://itsecurity.mssm.edu/email-access/external-webmail-access/).

The HPIMS Directory Form and MSCIC Onboarding Form should be submitted out before accessing data.

### Accessing Data

Before being added to an HPIMS Project, submit CITI training certificates, CV and the HPIMS Data Use Agreement (DUA) via the [Regulatory Submission Form](https://app.smartsheet.com/b/form/0e8ccccac1bc4614b8c17bd4ad8301c6) as per the HPIMS Onboarding SOP (which can be downloaded in the forms-and-docs folder). These documents should also be emailed to Eddye (eddye.golden@mssm.edu) with Ben (tben.glicksberg@mssm.edu) CC'd on the email.

As of September 2020, this form requires Certificates of completion of following CITI trainings:
  - Investigator/Research Staff Basic Course
  - HIPAA for Research Update
  - Data Security and HIPAA training
  - Rigor, Reproducibility and Ethical Behavior in Biomedical Research
  - Good Clinical Practice (if applicable)

Examples of the training certificates and a blank copy of the DUA are located in the forms-and-docs folder of this repository; the CITI certificates are in the subfolder /forms-and-docs/citi-certificates/.

A tutorial for completing CITI Trainings and downloading the certificates is located in the citi-tutorial folder.

Finally, the [HPIMS ticketing system](https://app.smartsheet.com/b/form/ab5208921ad64f02b322047d788a4605) can be used to request access to the HPIMS Azure and Minerva. The [MSCIC Onboarding Form](https://app.smartsheet.com/b/form/401a0e4404cc412fb7982c5f3022d9e0) grants access to the MSCIC data.
