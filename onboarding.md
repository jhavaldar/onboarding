### Accessing Sinai Central, Email, and Campus Wi-Fi via VPN

When your IT/Network access is established, you will be assigned an MSSM username, which can be used to access Sinai Central and your email.

First, you must set up two factor authentication [here](https://itsecurity.mssm.edu/vip-two-factor-setup/). If you are not on campus Wi-Fi, you must use the HPIMS Ticketing System to register your VIP token remotely. The Ticketing System can also be used to request access to data or VMs on Azure, or access to internal servers. Using VIP two factor authentication, you can use a VPN (such as BIG-IP Edge Client) to connect to campus Wifi and then access webmail.
