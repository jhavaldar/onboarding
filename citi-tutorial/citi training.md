HPIMS requires the Investigators/Research Staff, Data Security and Training, HIPAA Update, and Rigor, Reproducibility and Ethical Behavior in Biomedical Research, as well as Good Clinical Practice if applicable.

After clicking "Add a Course", you are led to a form with 10 questions. Completing this form will place you in a "learner group" and add the appropriate courses. Questions 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7 must be answered; the rest can be left blank as they do not pertain to the required courses for HPIMS.

**Question 1**: Choose the "Investigators/Research Staff" Basic Course:

**Question 2**: Choose "I have not completed the basic course":

**Question 3**: If you are required to complete the "Good Clinical Practice" module, check it to add the course (not applicable for those who do not work in a clinical setting):

**Question 7**: Select "Rigor, Reproducibility, and Ethical Behavior in Biomedical Research"

After submitting the questionnaire, you will be redirected back to the courses page; under "Active Courses", you should now see Investigators/Research Staff, Data Security and Training, HIPAA Update, and Rigor, Reproducibility and Ethical Behavior in Biomedical Research, as well as Good Clinical Practice if applicable. Complete all the required modules for each course.


After completing the required modules for a course, return to the courses page; for each course, click the option to view, print, or share the record:
